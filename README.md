# Robot Gladiators

## Description

Robot Gladiators is a browser-based combat simulator game that was built to enter in a fictional hackathon called the Con Solo Game Jam.

During the game, players coach their robot through a series of fights—gaining cash, attack power, and repairs along the way. The robot that survives with the most cash is remembered in the browser's storage system!

The game was built using HTML and JavaScript.
